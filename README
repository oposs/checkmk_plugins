Setup
-----

On Client
* copy plugin/* to /opt/oep/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins
* make sure they are executable

On Master and Slave Servers
* copy checks and checkman to /opt/omd/sites/prod/local/share/check_mk

On Master Server
* copy perfometer to /opt/omd/sites/prod/local/share/check_mk/web/plugins/perfometer


do whatever magic thing is necessary to make the server see the changes ... 

maybe 

$ check_mk -II

or

# omd restart

not quite clear on that one yet
